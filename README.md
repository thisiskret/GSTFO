# GSTFO (Griefers Stay The Fuck Out)
GSTFO is a *concept* mod for Payday 3 that uses an open-source and evidence-based database of confirmed griefers; it detects said griefers found on the database and blocks them for you automatically.

After over a year of Griefers running rampant in PD3, with them facing no consequences, it's time we take back control.

**To report a griefer or appeal your ban, join our discord server: https://discord.gg/PknfE7KHVe**
You can also join to discuss GSTFO or ask questions. 

# FAQ (Read this)

# 1. Why?
* Compared to Payday 2, Payday 3 has a very, very small and tight-knit active playerbase. If the game has just 2000 active players, it only takes 200 griefers to ruin every 2nd to 3rd heist. (do the math!) We've endured an entire year of griefers with little to no way of fighting back or preventing them joining our games. This mod is the first step before player kicking is added.
* This mod would also benefit not just the lobby leaders, but the one or two other heisters that could be present in your game, who would otherwise have to also suffer at the hands of a griefer. This mod benefits more heisters the more it's used.

* **TL:DR: PD3 suffers more from griefing than PD2.**

# 3. Are all Griefers permanently on the database?
* Yes*, there are 2 severity ratings and both require ban appeals in the Discord to have a chance at being lifted. Orange Severity Ratings get lifted easier than Red ones.
Originally only Red bans were permanent, but I've decided we do not want time to let griefers off the hook by itself.

# 4. Doesn't GSTFO promote or allow for harrasment like TF2's Tacobot.tf?
* No. We will never provide Steam Profile URLs or IDs, profile pictures, or any kind of personal data for griefers. We only show a griefer's SBZ Nebula username, and no matter how encrypted the names on the list are, the in-game block list won't be, and that can't be prevented. Just don't be a dick.
* We will never endorse individual harrasment or witch-hunting as that makes said witch-hunter basically just as sad as the griefer. Do *NOT* go out of your way to harass anybody on the database. You are just as much of a fucking loser if you do and you should touch grass.
* Cheaters and Griefers ruin the fun for everybody that has the displeasure of meeting them. We will never accept biased or fraudulent reports onto the database for innocent heisters that just play the game how they want to with no ill intent like tacobot.tf. We run on objective cold-hard evidence, not salty, cherry-picked and biased opinions.

# 4. Can I submit a griefer report without evidence?
* No. It would be irresponsible and down-right dangerous if the database ran on weak or limited evidence, as the mod would not be trusted. Every griefer report must have an accompanying video clip in good, readable 1080p HD quality.
* The Severity rating of their griefing can be suggested with the report, but can be changed by a mod if deemed neccessary.

# 5. Why not implement this with kicking once it's added?
* The original concept for GSTFO was "GGTFO" which would kick griefers once they're in the heist. GGTFO has several flaws and ways to exploit/reverse-engineer it, so for general safety and QoL, GSTFO will remain a mod that only blocks griefers. It's more convenient for the user anyways.

# 6. Wouldn't this make the game less beginner/noob-friendly like NGBTO?
* No, We will only accept reports for griefers of infamy 130 and above, on Overkill difficulty, on loud heists. Otherwise the player would be deemed too new or clueless to be added to the database.
* We don't want to prohibit new players who don't know any better from playing the game if they just made a mistake or two. We've all been there. We want to only prevent high-level, intentional griefers who actively try to ruin the game for not just other experienced heisters, but also those new players.

# 7. Why not just leave the heist?
* This is what the griefers want. For us to give up which makes them feel better about themselves and their sad life. We want to retaliate, not give in. You may have brought assets or bought favors that you were running low on and wanted to keep, you were deep into the heist and don't want to sacrifice the 20 minutes of your time that you've invested in progressing through it for no payout or xp. 
* Some people have jobs, school, etc, and don't have loads of free time to risk like that. Leaving sucks for the victim and makes the griefer feel better.

# Severity Ratings definitions, criterias and lengths:

a) Red:
**Deliberate malicious acts that hold a lobby hostage and/or waste people's time as much as possible.**
This also includes permanently hogging heist equipment or bags needed to progress or finish a heist. (Example: Road Rage's EMP)

b) Orange:
**Purposefully malicious acts that negatively affect the other heisters.** Easier to appeal than Red-level bans.
* Mass-Killing civs (genocide)
* Refusing to kill enemies (via a kill-counter HUD mod only)
* Refusing to communicate to force an objective early such as calling the Helicopter on Dirty Ice early or taking out the USB on F&G early. Case by case basis for these reports as it may be a mistake. Repeat offenders only possibly
* Preventing objectives outright to force their way of playing (Example: Killing the manager on dirty ice so the other heisters can't clean)
* Wasting limited resources on purpose (ARKs, FAKs or Medic Bags, must be spam consuming them to be considered griefing)
* Intentionally standing infront of or blocking view of a heister to annoy them (like a child)

# What has to be provided in a griefer report?
* The culprit's __**Starbreeze Nebula**__ username. Steam names are not always the same as the user's Nebula one, so you must obtain it through either the pre or post heist menus. It's the one in brackets. We are hoping to soon see a mod that reveals SBZ usernames ingame as well though. If the culprit leaves the heist early and you couldn't catch their SBZ name, you're out of luck.
* Along with this, **the culprit's Infamy has to be 130 or above.**
* Show in the clip(s) provided what they did. It has to be crystal clear and obvious what is being done wrong. The culprit's name-tag has to be clearly visible. **No leeway or weak evidence.** Start to finish, important context can't be missing.
* **The difficulty of the heist has to be shown, either via holding TAB or in the pre/post menus.** We will not accept reports from heists done on Normal, Hard or Very Hard as it's likely the culprit is just a new player.
* **The heist has to have gone loud.** If you don't want griefers while you're stealthing, play Solo Mode. You've been given a way to stealth griefer-free by Starbreeze, but loud players haven't.

# How do I appeal my ban?
